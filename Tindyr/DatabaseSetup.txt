Create a local db named TindyrDb

Run these commands (After you access Tools > Command Line > Developer Command Prompt)

cd Persistence //gets you in the Persistence project folder

dotnet ef migrations add [whatev] -s ..\Tindyr\Tindyr.csproj //adds a migration in the Persistence project - this is for later troubles, right now, we have a migration script, if it doesnt work just run the command with yourmigrationname instead of [whatev]-
dotnet ef database update -s ..\Tindyr\Tindyr.csproj //runs the migration from Persistence into Tindyr project, thus updating/creating all tables needed

You may need to install the dotnet ef feature for console
